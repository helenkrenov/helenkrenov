- 👋 Hi, I’m @helenkrenov
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the world, both inside and out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much everything - coding, basic high school subjects, culture, economic and political impacts on society, etc etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that might spark my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me email or instagram would be the most efficient.
